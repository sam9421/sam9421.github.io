    The "ideal" payroll-to-income percentage varies wildly between industries, from around 5 percent in the high-turnover food and beverage industry to significantly higher in the professions.

The Restaurant Business

Paying attention to costs of every kind is particularly critical in the restaurant industry, which tends to have particularly thin profit margins that run from 3 to 5 percent industrywide. Nevertheless, looking at a particular restaurant's percentage of payroll to income won't tell you everything you need to know about how well the restaurant is managing its labor costs. Fast-food restaurants, for example, typically pay low wages, so they have lower direct labor costs than restaurants higher up on the food chain. This can be misleading, however, because fast-food labor turnover is high. The lower direct labor cost may be accompanied by higher hiring and training costs.

Even among restaurants at the same level of service, labor costs may differ. A fine dining restaurant that makes bakery goods in-house will have higher labor costs than one that doesn't. A fine dining restaurant specializing in small plates will have higher labor costs than a top-of-the-line steakhouse.</title>

<title>If you are running a restaurant or food service business, you understand that the most important costs under your control are food (including beverages) and labor costs – together, known in the industry as prime costs. Being able to compare these costs – in a percentage format – against typical scenarios of other restaurant businesses is helpful in the management of your business. HTML</title>

Look at Prime Costs to Determine Success

In order to make money in the restaurant business, prime costs should generally be in the 60 percent to 65 percent range. How that breaks down between food and labor is less important than achieving a prime cost maximum that produces a satisfactory profit. So if one of the prime costs is in the higher range, the other prime cost must be in the lower range to achieve profitability. Remember it is the combination of food and labor that creates the bottom line.
    Certain fast food restaurants can achieve labor cost as low as 25 percent, while table service restaurants are more likely to see labor in the 30 percent to 40 percent range, depending on the menu and extensiveness of service. Food costs (including beverages) for the restaurant industry run typically from the 28 percent to 35 percent range, depending upon the style of restaurant and the mix of sales.
    How Food and Labor Costs are Calculated

Food and labor costs are calculated as a percentage of the total volume of sales. If a restaurant does $20,000 per week and the total cost of food and beverages is $7,000 for that week, then the food cost is considered 35 percent. If, at the same restaurant, labor (including payroll taxes and benefits) equal $5,000 for the week, then the labor cost is 25 percent. Total prime costs are 60 percent in this example.
